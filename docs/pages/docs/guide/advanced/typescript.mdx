# TypeScript

Nextra is built with TypeScript and provides excellent TypeScript support out of
the box. This guide will help you leverage TypeScript in your Nextra project.

## Getting Started

To use TypeScript in your Nextra project, you need to:

1. Install TypeScript and related dependencies:

```bash
npm install typescript @types/react @types/node
```

2. Create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root of your project:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "allowJs": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strict": false,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "incremental": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "jsx": "preserve"
  },
  "include": ["next-env.d.ts", "/.ts", "/.tsx"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

This configuration is based on the `tsconfig.json` file found in the Nextra docs
project.

## Type Definitions

Nextra provides type definitions for its components and configurations. You can
leverage these types in your `theme.config.tsx` file:

```tsx
import type { DocsThemeConfig } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

const config: DocsThemeConfig = {
  // Your theme configuration
}
export default config
```

3. When working with MDX compilation, Nextra uses TypeScript to define plugin
   types and options:

```tsx
import type { ProcessorOptions } from '@mdx-js/mdx'
import type { Root } from 'mdast'
import type { Plugin } from 'unified'

// ... plugin implementations
```

## TypeScript in MDX

You can use TypeScript in your MDX files by adding the `tsx` language identifier
to your code blocks:

```tsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  return <div>Hello, World!</div>
}
```

4. For theme development, Nextra provides type definitions for theme
   configurations. For example, in the docs theme:

```tsx
import type { DocsThemeConfig } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

const config: DocsThemeConfig = {
  // Your theme configuration
}
export default config
```

5. Nextra uses TypeScript to ensure type safety when working with configuration
options, page maps, and other data structures throughout the project.

By leveraging TypeScript in your Nextra project, you can catch errors early,
improve code quality, and enhance the developer experience with better
autocompletion and type inference.
